# Product Requirements Document: GitBook-Style Wiki

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an integrated, GitBook-style documentation hub (the "Wiki") within the Orange Sky Empathy Ledger application. This feature will serve as a centralized, read-only knowledge base for project history, tool guides, and operational procedures.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, critical project information—including a 6-month historical overview, guides for essential tools like Descript and Airtable, and best practices for using the Orange Sky Airtable base—is not centralized or easily accessible. This makes it difficult for team members and stakeholders to find information efficiently, leading to knowledge gaps and repetitive questions.

## 3. Goals & Objectives
*   **Centralize Knowledge:** Create a single source of truth for all project-related documentation.
*   **Improve Onboarding:** Provide clear, accessible guides for new and existing team members on tools and workflows.
*   **Enhance Discoverability:** Implement a user-friendly layout with robust search and tagging to make information easy to find.
*   **Deliver a Premium UX:** The wiki should be well-designed, accessible, and feel intuitive, similar to modern documentation platforms like GitBook.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Layout & Navigation
*   **GitBook-Style Layout:** The UI will feature a persistent left sidebar for navigation and a main content area on the right.
*   **Article Listing:** The sidebar will display a hierarchical list of all available wiki articles.
*   **Content Rendering:** The main content area will render Markdown content into clean, readable HTML.

### 4.2. Content Management
*   **Markdown-Based:** All wiki content will be created and managed as `.md` files stored within a `/docs` directory in the project's codebase.
*   **Content Structure:** The wiki will include pages for:
    *   A 6-month project overview.
    *   A guide on using the Descript tool.
    *   A guide on using Airtable for this project.
    *   An overview of the Orange Sky Airtable schema and best practices.

### 4.3. Search & Discovery
*   **Full-Text Search:** A search bar will be prominently available to allow users to search the full text of all wiki articles.
*   **Tagging System:** Articles can be assigned one or more tags (e.g., "guide", "airtable", "history").
*   **Tag-Based Filtering:** Users will be able to see tags on articles and potentially click them to see other articles with the same tag.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The wiki, including search, must be fast and responsive.
*   **Accessibility:** The interface must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring it is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.
*   **Read-Only:** The wiki is a read-only experience within the application. Content updates are handled by developers committing changes to the Markdown files in the repository.

## 6. Out of Scope (for this version)
*   In-app editing of wiki content.
*   User comments, discussions, or feedback sections.
*   Database-backed content or a CMS.
*   User-specific personalization.
